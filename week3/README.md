# Week 3: Using More SAP Fiori Elements Capabilities
In week 3, we create 3 more SAP Fiori elements apps: An Analytical List Page (ALP), an Overview Page (OVP), and another List Report Object Page (LROP). All 3 of them leverage XML annotations. For ALP and OVP we make use of the Guided Development in SAP Fiori tools and for the LROP of the XML annotation LSP. The LROP app is based on a non-SAP provided OData service.
